I leverage the national inventory of sewage treatment plants in India and various granular datasets on river water quality measures, as well as geo-localized information on child births and deaths, to identify robust effects of wastewater treatment installations.

I show that after starting wastewater treatment, levels of fecal coliforms decreased by 50%, and downstream mortality under the age of six months declined by 20%.

These impacts are partly direct, caused by hyperthermia, and partly due to reduced food availability. While numerous harmful health effects of hot temperatures have been established, little is known about the links between heat waves and anemia, a medical condition affecting one-quarter of people worldwide and 43% of India’s population. Using health, nutritional and climate data, we analyze the relationship between heat stress and anemia in India over the past decade. We examine both dry heat waves (high temperatures) and humid heat waves (combination of high temperatures and humidity). We find preliminary evidence indicating that heat waves worsen anemia in children and women. Moreover, the mechanism responsible does not seem to be related to reduced food availability. <br>\n*Draft coming soon*\n\n### Work in progress\n\n**Fertilizers, water quality and perinatal health in India** with Eléonore Rouault \n<br>\n\n### Publication\n\n**Mapping forward-looking mitigation studies at country level**, Claire Lepault and Franck Lecocq, *Environmental Research Letters*, Volume 16.8, July 2021 <br> [link to open access article](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac0ac8) | [code](https://github.com/ClaireLepault/Mapping-country-mitig-pathways)\n<br>\n\n### Other contributions\n\n* Contributing Author of [Chapter 4: Mitigation and development pathways in the near- to mid-term](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Chapter04.pdf) of the $6^{th}$ IPCC Assessment Report (AR6, WG III)\n      \n\n* Participation in the creation of the [AR6 Scenarios Database](https://zenodo.org/record/5886912#.YnF0v4Nfg8o)","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n### [Job market paper](./docs/JMP_CLepault.pdf)\n\n\n**Is urban wastewater treatment effective in India?
