These impacts are partly due to the direct effect of high temperatures on the human body, and partly due to vector-borne diseases and reduced food availability. While numerous harmful health effects of high temperatures have been established, there is little research into their possible impact on anemia, a medical condition affecting 25% of the global population and 43% of people in India. Using health, nutrition and climate data, we analyze the relationship between heat exposure and anemia in India over the past decade. We match blood hemoglobin measurements from nearly 259,000 children, 901,000 women and 138,000 men to two different measurements of exposure to heat, based on air temperature and wet-bulb temperature respectively. We find that heat exposure in the 30 days preceding blood measurement worsens anemia in these three population groups. Moreover, the mechanisms responsible do not seem to be related to reduced food availability, while malaria could explain part of the relationship between temperature and anemia. Finally, we estimate the number of extra cases induced by a +2°C increase in annual air temperature, which has an associated cost of around 7.6 bn US dollars, i.e., 0.2% of Indian GDP.\n</details>\n\n### Work in progress\n\n**Fertilizers, water quality and perinatal health in India** with Eléonore Rouault \n<br>\n\n### Publication\n\n**Mapping forward-looking mitigation studies at country level**, Claire Lepault and Franck Lecocq, *Environmental Research Letters*, Volume 16.8, July 2021 <br> [link to open access article](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac0ac8) | [code](https://github.com/ClaireLepault/Mapping-country-mitig-pathways)\n<br>\n\n### Other contributions\n\n* Contributing Author of [Chapter 4: Mitigation and development pathways in the near- to mid-term](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Chapter04.pdf) of the $6^{th}$ IPCC Assessment Report (AR6, WG III)\n      \n\n* Participation in the creation of the [AR6 Scenarios Database](https://zenodo.org/record/5886912#.YnF0v4Nfg8o)","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n### Working papers\n\n\n**Is urban wastewater treatment effective in India?
