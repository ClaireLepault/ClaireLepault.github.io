Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at the Paris School of Economics (PSE) and CIRED (via ENPC).  My advisors are [Hélène Ollivier](https://sites.google.com/site/heleneollivier/) and [Philippe Quirion](https://www.centre-cired.fr/philippe-quirion/).

My research lies at the intersection of environmental, development and health economics, more specifically on issues related to water pollution and climate change in India. 

**I am on the job market this year (2023/24).**

In spring 2023, I have been visiting the University of Oregon hosted by [Ed Rubin](http://edrub.in/).

Before the PhD, I received an engineering degree at ENPC and a master Analysis and Policy in Economics at PSE. Much of my motivation comes from experience working for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) at CIRED.
