<br>

Welcome! I am a **CIRAD researcher based at CIRED**. 

My research lies at the intersection of **environmental, development and health economics**. I have a particular interest in exploring how environmental issues, such as pollution and climate change, affect human health through their impacts on natural resources.

I completed my PhD at the Paris School of Economics and CIRED in September 2024.
