Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at Paris School of Economics (PSE) and CIRED research centre (via ENPC). 
In October 2024, I'll be a CIRAD researcher based at CIRED.

My research lies at the intersection of **environmental, development and health economics**, more specifically on issues related to water pollution and climate change in India. 

In spring 2023, I visited the University of Oregon. <br>
Before the PhD, I received an engineering degree at ENPC and a master Analysis and Policy in Economics at PSE. Much of my motivation comes from experience working for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
