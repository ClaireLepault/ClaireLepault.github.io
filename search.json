My advisors are Hélène Ollivier and Philippe Quirion.\nMy research lies at the intersection of environmental, development and health economics, more specifically on issues related to water pollution and climate change in India.\nIn spring 2023, I have been visiting the University of Oregon hosted by Ed Rubin.\nBefore the PhD, I received an engineering degree at ENPC and a master Analysis and Policy in Economics at PSE. Much of my motivation comes from experience working for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) at CIRED.\nContact : claire.lepault [at] psemail.eu\nPlease feel free to get in touch!"
